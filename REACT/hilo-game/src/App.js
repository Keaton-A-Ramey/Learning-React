  Variables:

                              and T/F value represents if card still in deck
  Double Lo-Odds  // Double containing odds on winning lo-bet
  Double Hi-Odds  // Double containing odds on winning hi-bet
  // Tie or Snap odds are constant: 12.5x

  String betType // Whether player bets on Hi, Lo, or Tie
  Integer currentCard // Current card on display that player has to bet on.

  Double balance  // Contains the player's balance to bet with
  Double currentBet  // Contains amount player is currently betting

  Boolean roundWon  // Indicates whether player bet was successful


  Methods: 

  DrawCard  // Take random number 0-51 and look through deck of cards for true, 
                return that index

  ShuffleDeck  // When all cards have been drawn, assign true to every card, clear the board
                // and basically start over

  ReadCard  // Takes card index and generates card name from it. Uses card number / 4 to get value
               and uses %4 to get suit.

  Payout  // Uses odds and bet to calculate winnings or loss depending on whether roundWon true or not

  Calculate Odds  // Determines (and assigns) Hi and Lo odds in current game state. 

  Make bet  // Takes credits from user balance and assigns amount to currentBet.

      <h1>Welcome to Hi-Lo!</h1>
      <p>Playing Hi-Lo is very simple; as the player, you 
        need to bet on whether the next card to be drawn from 
        the deck will be higher or lower than the current card. 
        You can also bet on the card being the same value as the current card â€“ 
        which is known as a tie. Hi-Lo (usually) is played 
        with a standard 52-card deck, and the value of 
        all the cards is determined by their rank; for example, Ace is always high, 
        while two is the lowest-possible value.</p>
